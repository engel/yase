Yase lets you crawl webpages and put them into a database where you can search them.

Currently the serverside crawler and indexer jobs runs pr account via php on the command line.

To use yase in its present form you will need to know how to use the command line in linux or cygwin and you will also need to be able to operate the mysql server.



dependencies:
-------------
 php: http://php.net  
 mysql: http://mysql.com
 xpdf: http://foolabs.com/xpdf/

make sure that the binaries from php,mysql and xpdf are available on your PATH before running the  yase serverside account scripts.

installation:
-------------
 load ./data/tables.sql into mysql
 configure ./classes/Global.php for your mysql user
 setup an account in ./account/


usage:
------
call yase.php from an embedded iframe on your webpage

see http://pedant.dk/projekter/yase/ for an example.
